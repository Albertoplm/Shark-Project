My first project in Iron Hack:
- In this project we have to analyse the Global Shark Attacks dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/teajay/global-shark-attacks) and come up with some hypotheses and check if they hold true.
- The process to carry out the project is as follows:
   1. First I have made a brief study of the database.
   2. Once I had a clear idea of what data was in the database, I created my hypotheses.
   3. I start the cleaning to keep only the data I need to test my hypotheses.
   4. Once I have the database clean I create a new file with that database.
   5. I download the new file into another document and start my analysis, creating graphs for the visualisation of the conclusions. 


## Hypotheses

1. **Sharks attacks men more often**
2. **The are more men who died by a Shark attack**
3. **Have been reported more shark attacks with people between the ages of 15 and 35.**
4. **The most common injury was to the leg**
5. **The most common shark attacks reported were by white sharks**
6. **They are more Sharks attacks during summer**
7. **Sharks more frequently attack people that are sufing**
8. **The percentage of deaths is higher in people that is diving than in people who practice surfing**

## Conclusions

### **H1 - Sharks attacks men more often**
